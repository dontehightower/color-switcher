#Color Switcher Exercise

The goal of this exercise was to render 32 boxes to the screen, one for each named color in CSS.
Each box should be filled with a random CSS color. Every 300ms, one random box should change
to display a different, random color.

The solution to this exercise is displayed and commented in src/App.js.
